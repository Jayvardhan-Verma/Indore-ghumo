    <p> Patalpani is a beautiful waterfall in the Mhow Tehsil of Indore and is one of the most magnificent and popular waterfalls in the state of Madhya Pradesh.

        The Patalpani Waterfall, formed by the Choral River, falls from a height of approx. 300 feet. The depth of the pond that develops at the bottom of the waterfall is unknown, but people colloquially say that it reaches the 'patal' (hell)depths. Hence the fall is known as Patalpani, where Patal means "under the earth's crust" and Pani means "water" in Hindi. <br><br><h2>Location - </h2><a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/mrLATNjkf3F9YESU8">Patalpani Waterfall, Kekariya Dabri, Madhya Pradesh 453441</a></p>

    <h1>Sirpur Lake</h1>
    <p>Dating back more than 130 years, the manmade lake of Sirpur was built by the ruling Holkars for water supply to Indore. Over time, Sirpur Lake evolved into a recreational spot, attracting locals and tourists alike for its serene ambience and lush surroundings. In the 1990s, Sirpur needed to be in better shape, as the locals would wash clothes and direct their sewage into the lake despite its recognition as an essential lake for birds. They recognised the lake's ecological significance as a refuge for migratory birds and an essential component of the city's ecosystem.<br><h2>Location -</h2><a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/1dJeSq5udP6Ez9876">Sirpur lake, Sirpur, Indore, Madhya Pradesh 452013</a></p>
